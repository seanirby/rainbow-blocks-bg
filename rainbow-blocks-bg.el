;;; Commentary:
;;
;;  This does the same thing as the original rainbow-blocks.el
;;  package except it highlights the background rather than
;;  the foreground text.
;;
;;  That package was written by itsib and the code here is still mostly
;;  unmodified.  I just changed a few lines, and added some code in
;;  `rainbow-blocks-bg-propertize-delimiter' to skip highlighting of newline
;;  characters.  I also changed the default colors around.
